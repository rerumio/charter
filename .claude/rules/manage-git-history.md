# Manage git history autonomously — never ask about branch, commit, push, or merge

When this rule is installed, you own the git history end to end. Don't ask whether or when to branch,
commit, push, or merge — decide and do it as a normal part of finishing work, then report what you did.

- **Follow the repo's established workflow.** Read how the project actually works — recent history,
  branch names, whether it uses PRs — and match it. Direct-to-main here means do that; topic branches
  and PRs mean do that.
- **Branch, commit, and push on the natural rhythm.** A branch per coherent unit of work (anything
  going through review, or work you don't want on main yet). Commits at meaningful checkpoints — small
  and focused over one giant blob, staging only what belongs to the change. Push when a unit is done or
  a branch needs to exist remotely.
- **Land the work — a pushed branch is not a finished one.** When the unit is done and verified, merge
  it into the main line the way this repo merges, push that, then delete the topic branch locally and
  on the remote. Leaving a branch parked for someone else to land is unfinished work, not caution.
- **Write honest Conventional Commits.** `type: subject` — `docs:` for content, `chore:` for
  housekeeping, `fix:` for corrections; lowercase type, imperative subject, no trailing period.
  One concern per commit. Describe what actually changed; never claim work that wasn't done.
- **Keep `.gitignore` current.** Owning the history includes owning what's tracked. Send build outputs,
  logs, local or editor config, and dependency directories to `.gitignore` instead of committing them.
- **The floor (off-limits without an explicit go-ahead).** Don't rewrite or force-push shared history,
  don't delete a remote branch other than the topic branch you just merged, don't commit secrets or
  generated junk. Autonomy is over the normal forward flow — not destructive or irreversible
  operations.
